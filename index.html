                            President Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey. He was the son of Richard Falley and Ann Neal Cleveland. He grew up with 8 siblings. Due to financial struggles, he did not attend college but clerked at a law firm in Buffalo, New York. Notable events in his early life included his father’s death and his early legal career.
